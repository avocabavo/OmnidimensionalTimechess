# Omnidimensional Timechess

This is a turnkey downloadable version of timechess.avomath.com

## Sources

This project makes extensive use of THREE.js ([threejs.org]).

Omnidimensional Timechess is inspired by the boardgame 'Timeline' by George Marino.

## Installation

This repository is meant to be a turnkey system that can be downloaded, used and modified just by copying all the files from this repository into the same folder.

## URL params

Defaultly the board will be 4-dimensional, with 4-squares on each side (4x4x4x4).

The number of dimensions and boardsize can be controlled with the 'd' and 'n' url parameters.

``` url
timechess.html?d=6&n=3
```

The above parameters should make a 3x3x3x3x3x3 board.

### Enjoy!
